PL² is a project addressing the opportunity gap for marginalized students through personal mentoring and tutoring with artificial intelligence learning software. [Pl2 website] personalizedlearning2.org/


Personalized mentoring and tutoring in small groups can promote the social, emotional, and motivational conditions that support student success. Learning software, powered by AI, adapts curriculum and content to each student's unique learning speed and style. PL² combines these two proven approaches to help mentors practice culturally-responsive teaching that is informed by their students' progress in learning software.

As a research data scientist, I look at the historical performance data for students from over 100 district public schools to trace their performance over three years. The insights drawn from the data sets are used to inform deicion makers at school to imporve instructional pedagogy and provide mentor supprot for students.
